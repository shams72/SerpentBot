# SerpentBot 

A smart Snake game which uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to intelligently hunt down its prey. Watch as the snake navigates the game board with purpose, always finding the optimal path to its next meal!

## Features

- **Autonomous Gameplay**: The snake plays itself, making strategic decisions in real-time
- **Classic Snake Mechanics**: All the nostalgic gameplay you remember, enhanced with BFS

## How It Works

The SerpentBot employs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm combined with the Manhattan distance heuristic to:
- Analyze the current game state
- Calculate the shortest path to the nearest food
- Avoid collisions with walls 
- Make optimal movement decisions
